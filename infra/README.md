# GITORC Private-Cloud Infrastructure

The `infra/` tree contains the sovereign infrastructure definition for GITORC. It is the source of truth for local bootstrap, private-cloud deployment, runtime governance, and operational policy.

## What This Stack Covers

- OpenStack networking: networks, subnets, routers, floating IPs, and load balancer attachment.
- Proxmox VE bootstrap for bare-metal and VM-hosted capacity.
- OpenStack identity: Keystone projects, service users, roles, and application credentials.
- OpenStack storage: Cinder classes, Barbican secrets, and Kubernetes storage integration points.
- OVN, OVS, and FRR network automation for routed cluster fabrics.
- Kubernetes platform modules: namespaces, storage classes, PVC-backed services, ingress, and service accounts.
- Rancher registration and cluster lifecycle automation.
- CI/CD runner infrastructure: dedicated runner pools, runner service accounts, and workload isolation.
- GPU worker enablement for accelerated workloads.
- Monitoring and logging: Prometheus/Loki-oriented manifests and scrape configuration.
- Secrets management: Barbican-backed secret references and CSI sync definitions.
- Runtime policy enforcement: Kyverno admission policy and OPA governance package.

## Deployment Model

1. Provision the private-cloud foundation with Terraform from `terraform/environments/private-cloud`.
2. Run the cloud bootstrap automation from `automation/workflows/cloud-bootstrap.yaml` using the Ansible playbooks in `ansible/`.
3. Apply the Kubernetes manifests from `kubernetes/base` and `kubernetes/platform` into the target cluster.
4. Configure environment promotion in `deploy/environments/`.
5. Enforce artifact and runtime governance from `policy/`.

## Constraints

- This stack targets private OpenStack, private Kubernetes, Keystone-backed identity, and internal runtime governance.
- No hyperscaler resources are referenced.
- Do not commit real secrets into this repository.
