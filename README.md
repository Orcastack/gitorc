# gitorc

gitorc is a self-hosted Git-centric DevOps platform blueprint for local machines and private infrastructure. It combines owned Git RPC, Gerrit-style review workflows, a CI/CD control plane, and a big-data backend based on HBase and Hadoop.

## Services

- `gitorc-git-service`: repository ownership, refs, commit/tree/file lookups, push ingestion.
- `gitorc-review-service`: changes, patchsets, comments, approvals, merge rules.
- `gitorc-ci-service`: pipeline orchestration, worker scheduling, logs and artifacts.
- `gitorc-cd-service`: deployments and rollback orchestration.
- `gitorc-analytics-service`: HBase/Hadoop-backed intelligence and metrics.
- `gitorc-gateway`: single API entrypoint for the UI and future external clients.

## Local quick start

1. Start infrastructure and services with `docker compose up --build`.
2. Open the UI at `http://localhost:5173`.
3. Check service health at `http://localhost:8080/healthz` through `http://localhost:8085/healthz`.
4. Extend the proto contracts in `gitorcapi/proto/gitorc/platform/v1/platform.proto` and implement handlers service by service.

## Current state

This commit establishes the platform skeleton and local runtime topology. It does not yet implement Git packfile handling, review persistence, pipeline execution, or HBase/HDFS writers. Those belong in the next implementation slices, but the repo is now structured around the intended platform instead of an unrelated application layout.
